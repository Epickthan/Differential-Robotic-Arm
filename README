3D printed arm that contains a differential as a 2 DOF wrist. Utilizes virtual 4 bar to rotate forearm. Contains 2 generic 12V motors, 3 servos, 2 Elegoo ONEs, DROK DC motor controller, breadboard, and an IR remote.

- Will face updates later

Issues:
- Slight delay from IR remote input
- Occasional offset from Differential system (Slipping?)
- Create full movements?
- Try researching ways to smooth servo movement
